So It is a good practice if such news can be verify on social media online with same application and prevent further effect.

For this project we were told to implement using C code. 

Now with the knowledge we had and because of the limitation of language. 
I designed a basic interface that allows the user to check the news and add more news, using File Handling.

I also implemented a very basic login and registration Interface to authenticate the user.
